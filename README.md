# Various teaching materials

This repository contains assorted scripts and materials for demonstrating geosocial media processing at the introductory level in several courses where I teach. 

Please note that the learning objectives do not include programming itself, so the code is not optimized for efficiency and does not always follow best coding practices. 

Instead, the main objective is to demonstrate the overall workflow and processing steps, so that the learner can adapt the code to specific circumstances, or even a different (preferred) programming language. 

However, suggestions for improving the code (or, of course pointing out problems) are always highly appreciated. 

Finally, I plan to replace this generic repository with more specific ones for each of the courses, with more materials. Once I find the time...
